# AWS Terraform modules for Toto
This repo contains all the Terraform modules to control the AWS infrastructure and deployments of Toto.

Toto supports: 
* [Deployment on AWS Sandbox](./docs/sandbox/main.md) - A sandbox environment will have many less barriers but might have some core restrictions (e.g. impossibility to create an IAM User)
* Deployment on owner AWS account - *to be done*

Note that another repo is used for [deploying Toto to GCP](https://github.com/nicolasances/toto-terra).
